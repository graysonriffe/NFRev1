---STEM Project---

--Ideas--

Bullet Hell (3D, but top-down)
Platformer (With a twist)
First Person Adventure (Story driven)

Something that multiplayer could eventually work with

--Development Notes--

Remember to use tasks (//TODO: )

*Engine (Name?) "Nothin' Fancy"
*Separate project
*Namespaced
*Debug and log system
NatVis
Command line options
Video options
*Alt-Enter
File IO functions
Options file (Executable directory)
Input
Audio
Game states
Text rendering
UI elements
Resource system and custom format
Read model objs and animations (Is this realistic?)
Layered batch renderer
Lighting? (Or is this part of the game's shaders?)
Multithreading and async tasks (For audio and loading?)

Figure out format for storing resources OUTSIDE of exe (compressed format?)
And separate tool to write those?
