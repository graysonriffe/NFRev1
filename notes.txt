---STEM Project---

--Ideas--

Bullet Hell (3D, but top-down)
Platformer (With a twist)
First Person Adventure (Story driven)

Something that multiplayer could eventually work with

--Development Notes--

Remember to use tasks (//TODO: )

*Engine (Name?) "Nothin' Fancy"
*Separate project
*Namespaced
Refactor NothinFancy.h to ONLY include stuff the frontend needs (Does deleteing uneeded public funcitons do anything?)
*AND get rid of NFENGINE
*High CPU usage?
*Debug and log system
*NatVis
*Config changing
*Alt-Enter
*File IO functions
*Keyboard and mouse click input
Check for memory leaks in deconstructors
Separate Model and UIElement from Drawable
Entity and Camera classes
Mouse position input
Audio
*Game states
Text rendering
UI elements
Resource system and custom format
Read model objs and animations (Is this realistic?)
Layered batch renderer
Lighting? (Or is this part of the game's shaders?)
Multithreading and async tasks (For audio and loading?)

Figure out format for storing resources OUTSIDE of exe (compressed format?)
And separate tool to write those?
