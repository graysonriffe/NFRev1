Nothin' Fancy (abbreviated as NF) is an experimental 3D game engine written in C++
for Windows. The engine allows the user to program 3D applications with high-level
C++. NF was created by Grayson Riffe in 2021. This manual aims to aid the user
with using NF to create games and visualizations. It contains the
[user guide](tutorial.html) and the [API reference](namespaces.html).
